# Leptospirosis Prediction Model

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model to determine the leptospirosis status of patients using demographic and clinical data. The dataset used in this project is provided in `train.csv`, with the variable descriptions available in `lepto_description.xls`.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Perform a thorough descriptive analysis of the dataset to identify patterns and significant variables.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model to predict the leptospirosis status of patients.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Deployment**: Provide predictions for a test dataset.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 1387 patients with demographic and clinical information. The target variable is `Final`, which indicates the leptospirosis status of the patient (1 for confirmed, 2 for not detected).

### Files in the Repository
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with patient data.
- `test_data.csv`: Test dataset for making predictions.
- `lepto_description.xls`: Description of variables in the dataset.
- `lepto_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow of the project, including data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `predictions.csv`: Predictions on the test dataset generated by the model.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Descriptive Analysis
A thorough descriptive analysis was performed to understand the data distribution, detect any missing values, and identify potential outliers. Key statistical summaries and visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps) were generated to uncover relationships between variables.

### Key Findings
- [Include key findings from your descriptive analysis here, e.g., significant correlations, distribution of the target variable, etc.]

## Predictive Modeling
The predictive model was developed using [specify the algorithm used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost]. Various preprocessing steps such as data imputation, normalization, and feature engineering were employed to improve model performance.

### Model Building
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting significant variables for the model.
- **Model Training**: Training the model using the training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using cross-validation and other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Performance
- [Include performance metrics and any validation results here]

## Predictions
The trained model was used to make predictions on the test dataset. The results are saved in `predictions.csv`.
